# TownWeather

Hello stranger! It's my personal weather app.  

This app created without storyboard and any xib files.

I used URLSession for networking and CLLocationManager to get location data.

Functionality: 

1. Shows current temperature in your location.

2. You can simply write city name and see: weather image, current temperature and how this temperature feels like.
                      
3. App supports light and dark mode.
